The information I found regarding the break instruction were very
different from each other. One thing that all of the sources agreed
on is that the BRK instruction points to the *second* byte after the
BRK address, so that there actually is a useless byte after it.

It's important to note that the useless byte is read anyway, even
if its value is not used anywhere.

Another thing that I wasn't sure about is whenever or not BRK is
executed even if the I flag is 1.
I've tested [Visual 6502](http://www.visual6502.org/) and it seems to
ignore the I flag, so that a BRK is always executed.

The last doubt was about setting or not the I flag, after pushing the
processor status to the stack. Only one source I read explicitly said
that the I flag is set to 1. Testing on the Visual 6502 confirmed that.
